SIMPLE changepoint package
==========================

The SIMultaneous Penalized Likelihood Estimate (SIMPLE) changepoint
package can be installed as either 1) the stand-alone core package
with the bare-bones algorithm (core_package) or 2) as a complete suite
designed for molecular dynamics analysis and visualization
(MDanalysis_package).

The core_package is a lightweight install and has been tested across
several platforms. The MDanalysis_package includes some additional
routines to preprocess trajectory data and visualize change detections
in VMD, and it has several dependencies on other molecular dynamics
libraries. We have made an attempt to include all of the dependencies
in this package, although installation is not straightforward and likely
needs to be customized to each computing environment.
