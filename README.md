SIMPLE changepoint package
==========================

The SIMultaneous Penalized Likelihood Estimate (SIMPLE) changepoint
package can be installed as either 1) the stand-alone core package
with the bare-bones algorithm (core_package) or 2) as a complete suite
designed for molecular dynamics analysis (MDanalysis_package).  If
choosing option 2, the MD analysis package will handle installation of
the core package.
